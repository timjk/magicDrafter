# Magic Drafter
Toy application that displays the community rankings of a given card when drafting in `MagicArena`.

## Description
Created primarily to learn Rust as such expect a lot of churn in the codebase as I learn best-practices, new approaches, new libraries etc...

- Creates a local sqlite db with card rankings for `Core Set 2020`

## Future features
- CLI that displays card rankings for the given pack
- Store scryfall & community rankings in a google doc, update local db from there
